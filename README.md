I created a weather app  that looks at the forcast in your city. I created this using javascript and API elements. 
currently updating the html page and making minor adjustments. 
I currently used this header from a personal picture and used a simple html setup
some code I soucred from stack overflow and tutorials on web APIs and other weather apps created. During this proccess, I learned which APIs works for this assignment, I also seeked help from tutors and fellow peers. It was interesting to see how my project looked compared to other classmates.
